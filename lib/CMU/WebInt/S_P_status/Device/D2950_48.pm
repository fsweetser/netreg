# In this package, every class/subclass must provide the following methods. All numberings are 1's based to match SNMP variables.
#  new - Create new object and sub objects as appropriate/possible
#  display - Show the contents of the object, this must support HTML-Table and HTML-Visual, the default will be HTML-Table
#  init - Initialize object with default values for the device represented, init may use SNMP to determine the type of object that it is.
#  update - Get values from the object either via SNMP or ssh/telnet.  SNMP is the prefered method
#  installed_in - Returns a pointer to the object that the object is installed in.  installed_in for S_P_status objects returns UNDEF.
#  child_count - Returns the number of child objects in this object (chassis in S_P_status, blades in chassis, ports in blade etc)
#  get_child - returns a child object, takes child number, returns UNDEF for ports
#  s_p_name - returns the name of the S_P_status.

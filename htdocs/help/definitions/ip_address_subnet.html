<p><a name="ip_address_subnet"></a><b>subnet - </b>A subnet is a way
to refer to a logical block of IP addresses.  For example, one subnet
may be used to refer to addresses between 10.0.1.0 and 10.0.1.255.
Ultimately, the subnet determines what IP address the
machine receives.  What subnet a particular machine should be in
depends on several factors, such as the physical location of the
machine, the physical connection of the machine, and sometimes even
the department affiliation of the machine, or even the specific
purpose of the machine, in the case of servers and network hardware.
When registering a machine, or changing its subnet, the system allows
you to choose the new subnet directly, or to receive help in
determining the subnet based on the Building or Network the
machine is connected to.</p>

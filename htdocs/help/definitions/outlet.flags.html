-</b> Flags are administrative bits that can be set to denote
something special about a particular outlet or machine.

<ul>
  <li>Abuse: the abuse flags prevents the outlet/machine from being
      modified by anyone except network administrators.
  </li>
  <li>Suspend: similar to abuse, except the outlet/machine actually
      gets suspended.  Outlets will get deactivated at the device they
      are connected to.  Machines will no longer propagate to DNS and
      DHCP servers.
  </li>
  <li>Permanent: some cables are permanently attached to specific
      network devices, and the specific ports are enabled/disabled
      as needed.  Redidence connections are all permanent, and 
      many lecture halls and classrooms have permanent connections. 
  </li>
  <li>Activated: a user has registered the outlet for use, either by
      paying for an academic/administrative activation, or by 
      registering a machine to a permanant connection.
  </li>
</ul>

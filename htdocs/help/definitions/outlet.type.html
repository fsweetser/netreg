<p><a name="outlet.type"></a><b>outlet type -</b> The type indicates
the data transport speed of the outlet and whether it is switched or
shared. The higher the number, the faster data will be transmitted to
and from your machine. A shared outlet is one that shares the
connection with other outlets, and so your connection may be impacted
by the network activity of other users who are also sharing the
connection. A switched outlet is one that retains the full capacity of
the connection for itself. </p>

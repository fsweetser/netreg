<p><a name="mode"></a><b>mode (IP address)</b> - An <a href=
"../pages/glossary.shtml#ip_address">IP address</a> can be either
static or dynamic. If you have a static IP address, your machine will
be given the same IP address every time it connects to the network. If
you have a dynamic address, your machine will most likely have a
different IP address every time it connects to the network or its DHCP
lease is renewed.</p>

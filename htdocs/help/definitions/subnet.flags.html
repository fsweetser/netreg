<p><a name="subnet.flags"></a><b>subnet flags -</b> This flag determines 
whether or not the subnet is integrated into the DHCP configuration to use DHCP,
and whether static registrations will be permitted based on the options 
that are checked. Checking the <i>no_dhcp</i> option indicates that DHCP 
is not being used. Checking the <i>no_static</i> option indicates that no 
static registrations are allowed on the subnet. Both of these options 
cannot be checked at the same time. </p>

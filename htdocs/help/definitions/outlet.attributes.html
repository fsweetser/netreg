<p><a name="outlet.attributes"></a><b>attributes (outlet) - </b>
Attributes are transient states that indicate that an outlet/cable is
waiting for an action (either an ACTIVATION or DEACTIVATION) to occur.
For residence hall users, this is handled automatically by a script
that runs several times a day, so attributes are fleeting.
Academic/administrative connections require individual attention,
because they must be connected to specific equipment per the <a
href="../pages/glossary.shtml#outlet.type">"type"</a> required for
that location.  Once the action has occured, the attribute is removed
from the outlet.  Attributes are most useful to determine what actions
are waiting to occur, not to determine if an outlet is currently
activated.  </p>

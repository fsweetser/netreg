<p><a name="mac_address"></a><b>hardware address</b> -
(sometimes called MAC address or ethernet address) All ethernet
cards, whether wired or wireless, have a 12-digit hexidecimal
number (which means it can contain the letters A through F in
addition to numerals) that uniquely identifies it. When you connect
your machine to the network, the network uses this number to verify
that your machine is registered. For information on how to find
your card's hardware address, see <a href=
"/help/topics/hardwareaddress.shtml">Finding Your Hardware Address.</a>
An example of a hardware address is 00E02938A48C.</p>

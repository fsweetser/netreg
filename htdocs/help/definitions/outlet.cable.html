<p><a name="outlet.cable"></a><b>cable - </b> Cable (outlet) - The
data outlet that users connect their machines to are actually one end
of a single cable run, that terminates in a room of network equipment.
The "Outlet Number" actually identifies the cable by indicating the
physical locations of each end using a labelling scheme appropriate
for the type of cable installation.  So what is often referred to as
an outlet number is actually a cable designation.  The "from" and "to"
vernacular that is used in some documentation is really just another
way of expressing "that cable that runs FROM here TO there."
Cables/Outlets are not a network connection until they are attached to
a <a href="../pages/glossary.shtml#outlet.device">device</a>/<a
href="../pages/glossary.shtml#outlet.port">port</a> that will supply
network connectivity to that cable.  For an outlet that users would
plug their computers into, the bottom line ('To') is the end of the
cable in their office or residence.  The Top line ('from') is the end
that will be connected to the network equipment.  Therefore, the two
pieces are unique identifiers that work together to identify a single
cable run.  This means that if any part of the outlet label is
obliterated, it may be possible to figure out the rest from what is
readable.  Pattern counts, so a typical label would look something
like this:

<pre>
    13@01-342-E7  
    13@01-@E032
</pre>

See <a href="/help/pages/outlet-reg.shtml">Registering an Outlet</a>
for more information about how to do this.</p>

<p>Additionally, the Cable ID is a unique number that is assigned to
an outlet/cable for internal use within the registration system.  It's
function is primarily for use within the registration system itself,
as a unique database identifier.  </p>

# QuickReg Configuration
# QuickReg is a feature of NetReg that enables users
# to connect to the network, get a non-global IP address, and be directed
# into the registration system. The system detects that they are coming

# and makes the registration process extremely simple.

# To enable, uncomment this line.

# This can be either 'no_regs' or 'machine_unreg'. If 
# no_regs, users get passed to the quickreg machine registration if
# they have NO machine registrations whatsoever. In 'machine_unreg', 
# they are passed if the machine they're connecting from is 
# unregistered. (In both cases they need to be on a subnet with the
# prereg_subnet flag defined.)

        # The table threshold is a percentage. The map starts from a

        # space into buckets. If more than table-threshold buckets have subnets
        # in them, a table of the space will be printed. Otherwise it skips the
        # top view and recurses, printing only the lower level subnets.

        # So if you want to see more aggregated views, adjust this down. The
        # valid range is 0.0 to 1.0.
        table-threshold = 0.15

        # The bucket step is the number of bits we step between analyzing blocks.
        # So for example if bucket-step is 8, we start at 0/0 and each bucket will
        # be a /8. Then it will look at each /8 and look at buckets of /16.

        # While you could, in theory, have buckets of /7, /5, etc., it probably
        # only makes sense to use power-of-2 buckets.

        # Sometimes you want to display a CIDR block that doesn't have enough

        # you can force blocks to be displayed by adding force definitions.
